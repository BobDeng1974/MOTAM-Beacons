# **MOTAM - Beacons** #

Here you can find all the beacons development of MOTAM infrastructure. The different types of beacons have been developed on different hardware platforms according to the different needs and requirements of each of them.

## **nRF52** ##

nRF52 platform provides a good way of explore Bluetooth 5 possibilities such long range coverage and extended advertisements and this allows for developing new security schemas and solves some limitations like little BLE coverage.

More information inside *nRF52* folder.


## *libraries* folder ##

Here is necessary libraries for compile and upload Arduino sketches. Some of the libraries are written for MOTAM platform. Another ones are written by third parties and are necessary for the right operation of the sketches.

Folders and files within this folder must be placed at libraries folder of Arduino IDE (in Windows, usually in C:/Users/user/Documents/Arduino/)
